# We use anygrasp sdk to generate origin grasp poses

- Before you run the code, please make sure you have installed anygrasp sdk, and have the access to it
- We suppose you to first generate multiple grasp poses for each object
- Then you can use the generated grasp poses to generate tactile pointclouds
- Finally, cut the single-camera pointcloud and add the tactile pointclouds as input, and cut the object pointcloud as output
